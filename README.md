# Github CV

In other words, your resume via your Github repos. This app will go to your github account and collect all repos with a one-line description and a url. It will then present a 'portfolio page' with said collection.

You can test it out by going to the site, or directly to your portfolio page:

`https://githubcv.herokuapp.com/<your github handle here>`

Please beware, the first time will be slow as I have yet to add any background workers or checks to ensure that the screen grabber is doing its job.

Shout out to the [webshot](https://github.com/vitalie/webshot) gem.

Enjoy!
